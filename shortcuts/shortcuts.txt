In your crypto tracker project, 1d, 7d, and 1m are time intervals used to represent the period over which a cryptocurrency’s percentage price change (or other metrics) is calculated.

Here’s what they mean:

Term	Meaning	Example in Crypto Context
1d	1 day – Data from the past 24 hours	Price change in the last 24h
7d	7 days – Data from the past week	Price change in the last 7 days
1m	1 month – Data from the past 30 days	Price change in the last month
